# CyberScent: Capstone Frontend Webapp

This website is my final capstone project. It's a simple website that utilizes React+Vite and is composed of 4 pages. 2 of which are interactive, the rest is a simple static page built in react.

Once the backend server is running, you should be able to run this with the command "npm run dev"
